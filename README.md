## Welcome to my TodoMachine ðŸ‘‹

TodoMachine is a task management application built with React.js. It allows users to create, complete, and delete tasks efficiently, utilizing all the features and tools that React offers.

## Features

Task Creation: Quickly and easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
Task Completion: Mark tasks as completed to keep track of your progress.
Task Deletion: Remove completed or unwanted tasks with ease.
Real-Time Updates: All changes are instantly reflected in the user interface.
User-Friendly Interface: Clean and simple design aimed at enhancing the user experience.

## Technologies Used

React.js: The main library for building the user interface.
React Hooks: For state management and side effects.
React Context API: For global state management.
CSS Modules / Styled Components: For component styling (choose one depending on what you used).

### App

The app will be available at https://cahb142.github.io/TodoMachine/

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Usage

Add a Task: Type the task in the input field and press "Add" or "Enter."
Complete a Task: Click the checkbox next to the task.
Delete a Task: Click the delete button next to the task.
